# Bounded Denoiser with Lipschitz Convergence and Jacobian Regularization



**Stabilizing Plug-and-Play Reconstruction with Bounded Denoiser with Lipschitz Convergence and Jacobian Regularization**
**Period:** March 2026
**Tech:** Python, jax, Unet, Diffusion, ViT

## Overview

The methodology of bounded denoiser will be experimented with Lipschitz Convergence and Jacobian Regularization.
(Jacobian Regularization → Lipschitz Continuity → Convergence)
This experiment studies that maintaining a Lipschitz constant L≤1 prevents the catastrophic error propagation typically observed in multi-iteration PnP frameworks.
the major goal of this experiment is to stabilize inverse problem pipeline in Vision models as effectively suppressing accumulation of artifacts when iterations increase at small -$\sigma$

**Core idea:**

> Use Lipschitz Convergence and Jacobian Regularization to ensure stabilization of diminishing-$\sigma$ and provide fixed-point convergence guarantees even in nonconvex and ill-posed inverse problems


## Key Contributions

1. **Investigation of bounded denoiser methodologies**

   * Work research and analysis of the specific methodologies regarding bounded denoiser's role and its ongoing experiments in Plug-and-Play optimization and in iterative inverse problems

2. **UNet, Diffusion, Vit bridging solutions**

   * Comparison among different models for examining the optimal x* and its applications with emphasis on stability and reconstruction quality.

3. **Continuation schedule integration**

   * A continuation-based update schedule into the experimental pipelines, enabling systematic control of the optimization trajectory and stability under diminishing-noise or adaptive-penalty settings.

4. **Unifying experimental framework**

   * A consistent experimental framework for evaluating denoiser regularization, model architecture, and continuation schedules.

## Safety Notes (Medical Use)

This repository is **research-only**. Outputs from generative models can be misleading even when visually plausible.
Always evaluate with diagnosis-aware metrics and boundedness checks before any clinical interpretation.
